> parliament.js is a functional programming utility belt in the vein of
Underscore, Lodash, Ramda, Highland and similar libraries. It is contained in
one tiny and tidy ES6 file.

## Install
```
npm install parliament
```

## Why not X?
When in doubt, use Lodash. But that doesn't stop me from writing this :)
